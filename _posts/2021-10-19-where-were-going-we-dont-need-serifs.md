Great Scott! Here's a blast from the past, Marty McFly and the Delorien in all their 80s glory. But the title text of the film here really steals the show. It's bold and bright, and seems to be flying off the screen - the slanting of the letters gives the font a dynamic feel, as if it's about to whoosh right off the page.
