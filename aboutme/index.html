		<h2>Origin Story</h1>
				<p>In the winter of '91 I made my debut on planet earth on what I'm told was a rather mild
					Thursday in South Africa. I grew
					up in beautiful (boiling) Durban until emigrating to the UK with the
					rest of my family in 2006. After spending most of my time here living
					 in Berkshire, I finally discovered and fell in love with Oxfordshire,
					 and my partner and I are now happily settled in Abingdon.

		<br><h1>My Hobbies</h1><br>
			<p>One of my favourite and longest hobbies is art and crafts, pictured
				are a few of my recent paintings (many unfinished as has become the
				 habit), but I also like crochet and sculpture. <br><br>When I was 23 I started
				 a small business called Pastel Pets where I painted pet portraits for
				 clients and crocheted custom teddy bears which I sold on commission in
				 a few independent shops in England and Wales. Nowadays, I tend only to pick
				 up a paintbrush for therapeautic reasons. Watercolours are my favourite medium.

  <p class="img__description"><br><br>One evening in November '18, I packed this
	small backpack and booked a flight to Amsterdam on a whim.<br>
		<br>I spent three days going museum hopping, sketching the canal views outside rustic cafes, and trawling the street markets. <br>
		<br>It was beautiful, but absolutely<br> freezing!</p>

		<h1>My Life</h1><br>

		alt="">
			<p>I have three children; Chase, Ryder and Jessica, who keep me constantly on my toes!
				They each have unique personalities and are a joy to look after (as a grown woman, it's also great to have an excuse to
				go see Pixar films at the Cinema).
				<br><hr><br>

				alt="">
				I love cooking, especially Italian. My grandparents were of that origin and I'm certain the taste in food is genetic!
				My favourite dish to cook is mushroom risotto (here's one I made earlier), it takes a little bit of work during cooking, but I promise it's worth it. Find the recipe <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/mushroom-risotto/">here</a>.

				My family and I are very close, I have two younger (and taller) sisters, and my mother who lives in Berkshire. She runs several pubs in the area and we regularly meet for
				gins and a natter. The picture here is from the Rugby World Cup final last year, and whilst we were thrilled with the result,
				the four cheering South Africans in Springbok jerseys didn't go down too well with the punters!
