I'm an avid Film and TV watcher and have become fascinated with examining the techniques networks use to appeal to and draw in viewers. Posters and promotional material are all designed to subtly feed us so much information about the story to pique our interest before we even tune in. 

Artwork, lighting, wardrobe; all of these features are expertly manipulated to influence emotion, tell the story, and stir empathy for the character. Less obvious than these, but one of the most effective and simplest devices, is the use of typography.

In this blog I aim to explore the application of various typographical characteristics and how effective they are in influencing viewers. I'll be taking a deeper look into why we subconsciously respond to the appearance of words more than what they're saying, and why networks make these choices.

Word watch is a play on the phrase "bird watch", and as my television *watching* habits inspired the concept for this blog, I thought it fit!

I designed the logo to look like a tv network logo, usually badge-like with a circle and a number or letter in it, the typography of which I found commonly seemed ribbon-like in nature.
